Hi My name is Stranger and i'm not a terrorist.
I'm an aspiring young software engineer.
I love solving problems and try to see things from all perspectives.
I love to make things simplier than usual, that's why i'm not bombarding you with big grammers lol.
You like me yet, winks, but why should you hate, you don't know me yet, but thanks for taking your time to read.
